    <p>
        You can fill and top your crêpes with whatever you like! Popular choices include whipped cream, fresh fruit, fruit sauce, cream cheese, and chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella). You can also make savory crepes with cheese, meats, and veggies.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
